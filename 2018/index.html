            designed to provide middle and high school students from the Issaquah School District
            an opportunity to learn professional coding and business skills (that they don't 
            teach you in school!), create impactful projects, and win cool prizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            TechnoHacks will be held at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7pKb5RyLTZoJXPzQ9" target="_blank">Skyline High School</a> 
            on March 22, 2025, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
          </p>
          <p>
            The theme is <strong>sustainability</strong>. Students
            will create projects addressing one of the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nation's 17 Sustainability Goals</a>
            to contribute to a better world for everyone.

          <h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
          <p>
            A hackathon is where you turn your crazy ideas into real stuff. You'll learn how to 
            design or code an app, learn from industry professionals, and pitch your idea to judges!
            Students from all across the Issaquah School District will gather for a day of 
            innovation and learning. You take care of the building, we take care of you.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            We will be following TechnoHack's <a class="no-decorate" href="https://github.com/tiredwren/technohacks-documents/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md" target="_blank">Code Of Conduct</a>.
          </p> -->
          <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
          <p>
            TechnoHacks is completely free! Snacks and caffine will be provided, but meals
            will not; there are several places to eat nearby, so bring some cash or lunch from
            home if you think you'll need it!
          </p>
          <h2>How many people can be in a team?</h2>
          <p>
            Four students are allowed per team. There should be at least two people in each 
            teamâ€”we work better together than we do alone! You can register with your team or 
            find one through <a href="https://discord.gg/84pHtwX9gx">Discord</a> or the a team 
            mixer at the start of the hackathon.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>What can I build?</h2>
          <p>
            You can build or code whatever you'd like, but we recommend a mobile app!
            We will not be providing any hardware materials, so if you're planning on going that 
            route, be sure to bring your own tools. Any project that targets one of the UN's 17 Goals 
            is acceptable.
          </p>
          <h2>What if I don't know how to code?</h2>
          <p>
            No worries! TechnoHacks is all about learning, so we don't expect you to build a 
            fully functional app at all. We'll teach you how to create an idea, wireframe it, 
            and pitch it, so you can get your idea out there without having to code at all!
          </p>
          <h2>Is it overnight?</h2>
          <p>
            Due to venue restrictions, TechnoHacks will be held only on one day due to venue constrainsts,
            but you'll still have plenty of time to make your idea a reality, especially since we don't expect
            your hack to be fully functional!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>Why the UN's 17 Goals for Sustainability?</h2>
          <p>
            TechnoHacks was inspired by <a href="https://technovationchallenge.org/">Technovation</a>, 
            an international app development competition that encourages participants to create 
            a solution for one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.
            We believe that creating with the goals in mind helps us build projects that help 
            others, which is what tech is all about.
          </p>
          <h2>Who can attend?</h2>
          <p>
            TechnoHacks is open to all middle and high school students from the Issaquah School District.</p>
            <p>
              Don't worry if you're completely new to hackathons; we will be holding workshops 
              where students can learn how to get started with ideation, web/app development, 
              code collaboration, and more.

                MealShare is a platform that connects businesses, restaurants,
                and individuals with surplus food to local shelters and food banks, making food donations fast and efficient. It automates logistics, tracks impact and helps reduce food waste while fighting hunger and promoting sustainability.

              <p>
                The idea for our mobile application, ReClaim, came from personal experiences and things that we learned about at school. Grace came from Taiwan where there would be water shortages during the summer, and Rishab had read articles about how certain places in the world lack water resources; these led to us thinking about the importance of water conservation. With our main focus on the United Nations' Sustainable Development's 6th goal - Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All - and a few others (such as SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 13: Climate Action, and SDG 15: Life on Land), we decided to make an educational mobile APP that encourages the user to monitor their water usage, recycle, and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle overall by gamifying the experience. The application tracks and rewards the user for recycling objects by adding the object to the survival game section of the application, which would in turn progress their game and keep their character alive. The game character also has health points that are directly influenced by water points, and the user's water usage input would determine how quickly the water points drain.
