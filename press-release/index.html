        <p style="justify-content: center;">Sammamish, Washington – 2025</p>
        <h style="justify-content: center;"2>TechnoHacks, the Issaquah School District’s Premier Hackathon</h2>
        <p>TechnoHacks is a weekend-long invention marathon for Issaquah School District middle and high schoolers as an introduction to the professional tech and business world. The event is scheduled for February 8 and 9 of 2025, at Skyline High School. 
            TechnoHacks encourages Sammamish and Issaquah’s younger generation to enter STEM, exposing them to the excitement of coding and entrepreneurship. Open to students of all experience levels, participants will form teams, brainstorm, and develop innovative projects that address the United Nations' 17 sustainable goals. The event is especially catered towards beginners, with workshops and mentoring to guide them through their first hackathon. 
            "I participated in my first hackathon in my freshman year, and that's what led me to discover my passion for app development and entrepreneurship. I hope TechnoHacks can have the same effect on students and encourage them to explore everything technology and business can accomplish together,” explained Sneha Moudgalya, founder and lead organizer of TechnoHacks. 
            Saisha Pandit, a student registered for the event, said, “I’m excited to be in my first hackathon! I have no previous experience in coding and can’t wait to learn how to create an impactful project. I hope to leave with meaningful connections and an insight into the tech world.” </p>
        <p><strong>About TechnoHacks:</strong></p>
        <p>TechnoHacks was founded by Skyline High School students who love app development and want to share their passion with others. Realizing the lack of free tech and entrepreneurial competitions in the Sammamish-Issaquah area, we wanted to host inclusive events where students can explore, innovate, and learn. Our mission is to empower students with the skills and confidence to tackle real-world challenges while building a community that celebrates creativity and collaboration. TechnoHacks aims to inspire the next generation of leaders in technology and entrepreneurship.
